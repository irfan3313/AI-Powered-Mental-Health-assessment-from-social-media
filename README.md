Objective
To develop an AI system that can analyze usersâ€™ social media posts to assess potential signs of mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress) using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) models.


guage patterns to mental health conditions.

Study existing datasets and methods (e.g., CLPsych, eRisk, Reddit Depression Dataset).

Define ethical considerations and data privacy standards.

Phase 2: Data Collection & Preprocessing
Goal: Gather and prepare relevant social media data for analysis.

Tasks:

Source anonymized text data from Reddit, Twitter, or public mental health forums.

Label data (manual or weakly supervised) as "depressed", "anxious", "neutral", etc.

Preprocess text:

Tokenization

Lemmatization

Stop-word removal

Spelling correction

Emojis, hashtags, and slang handling

Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Goal: Understand language patterns, trends, and class distribution.

Tasks:

Word frequency and sentiment score analysis.

N-gram analysis to find common phrases used by different classes.

Visualize with word clouds, sentiment trends, and timelines.

Phase 4: Feature Engineering
Goal: Extract meaningful features from the text.

Types of Features:

Linguistic Features: LIWC categories, sentiment scores, emotion lexicons

Statistical Features: TF-IDF, bag-of-words

Semantic Features: Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), contextual embeddings (BERT)

Phase 5: Model Building
Goal: Train models to classify or assess mental health conditions.

Tasks:

Baseline: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM

Deep Learning: LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN for text

Transformers: Fine-tune BERT/RoBERTa for classification

Model tuning with cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization

Phase 6: Evaluation
Goal: Assess model performance using robust metrics.

Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC-AUC for binary/multiclass classification

Confusion matrix to analyze prediction behavior
